# DEW — Digital Carbon Cleanup Platform

🏆 **Hult Prize OnCampus 2025 – Second Prize**  
Team: Fourbeswu

---

## 🌍 Problem
Digital “dark data” — unused photos, files, and emails — continuously consumes storage resources and generates hidden carbon emissions.
Despite growing awareness of sustainability, most users lack practical tools to manage digital clutter and understand its environmental impact.

---

## 💡 Solution
**DEW** is an AI-assisted digital data cleanup platform that connects everyday file organization with measurable carbon reduction and behavior change.

The platform:
- Automatically identifies unnecessary digital data
- Visualizes carbon reduction achieved through data deletion
- Encourages sustained engagement via rewards and incentive mechanisms

---

## ⚙️ Technical Overview (Prototype Level)
- **Automated data classification** (AI-assisted, prototype implementation)
- **Carbon estimation logic** based on conservative international standards
- **Behavior-driven incentive design** linking cleanup actions to rewards

> This project focuses on system design, feasibility validation, and usability evaluation rather than production-level deployment.

---

## 🧪 Implementation Status
- A **functional prototype** was developed for the competition.
- **Internal usability evaluation** was conducted with target users.
- Due to ongoing competition participation (Hult Prize OA → National stage),  
  **source code is not publicly released**.

## ⚠️ Notes
This repository documents a **competition-driven prototype project**.
The implementation scope was intentionally limited to align with competition rules and intellectual property considerations.
